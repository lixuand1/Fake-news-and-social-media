# Fake-news-and-social-media
Conventional Research Project submitted for the Computing Project (COMP90055 - 25 credit points) of Unimelb.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In this project, machine learning methods and neural networks are trained to classify and analyze sentiment of fake and real news on social networks.

All the codes are in the code folder;

The files in the relative path used in code are in the Desktop/dataset;

All the datasets are in Desktop/dataset and we also provide dataset.zip for downloading easily.

Harvester: harvester_fakenewsnet.py and harvester_credbank.py

Python machine learning: ML_ver.py, including data-preprocessing, featrue selection, Naive Bayes model training, Decision Tree model training, Random Forest model training and sentimental analysis.

Neural network model:BiLSTM.ipynb and Glove method:https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/

Sentimental analysis:Feature_Sentiment.ipynb which is used after all data being processed.

Test data set process: Testset_Preprocessing.ipynb which is only for data pre-processing used for test data.
